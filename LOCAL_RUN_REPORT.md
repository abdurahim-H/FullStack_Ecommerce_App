Local run verification — concise report

Summary
-------
Goal: confirm the cloned repo runs locally and is end-to-end self-contained.
Verdict: Not fully self-contained out-of-the-box. Backend migrations fail on some environments because the payments app imports the Stripe library at module-import time; the installed stripe package in this environment raises ModuleNotFoundError: 'stripe.six.moves'.

What I did (high level)
-----------------------
- Restored repo to committed state and ran Django migrations.
- Observed import error when Django loaded `payments` (stripe import failure). I captured the traceback.
- As a temporary aid I added a guarded include for `payments` so `migrate` could run; I documented findings in this report.

Key evidence
------------
- Command: /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/.venv/bin/python backend/manage.py migrate --noinput
- Failure: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'stripe.six.moves' (raised from stripe.util when importing stripe)

Root cause
----------
- The payments code imports `stripe` at module import time; the stripe package installed in the venv expects `stripe.six` (missing) leading to immediate import failure. This is an environment/package compatibility issue, not a logic bug in your edits.

Risk & impact
-------------
- Developers without the exact compatible stripe package will see Django import errors and cannot run management commands or start the server.

Recommended fix (short)
-----------------------
1) Robust code change (recommended): lazy-import stripe in `backend/payments/views.py` (move `import stripe` into functions or add `get_stripe()`), and provide an optional local mock (enabled via env var) so the app can run end-to-end without contacting Stripe.
2) Alternative quick test: pin/install a compatible stripe version in the venv (e.g., reinstall stripe==2.60.0) and verify import. This is faster but less robust.

Repro commands (to verify locally)
---------------------------------
1) To reproduce the error (as currently observed):
  /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/.venv/bin/python backend/manage.py migrate --noinput

2) Quick environment test (try reinstall):
  /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/.venv/bin/python -m pip install --force-reinstall 'stripe==2.60.0'
  /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/.venv/bin/python -c "import stripe; print(stripe.__version__, stripe.__file__)"

Files I changed (temporary)
---------------------------
- backend/my_project/urls.py — temporarily wrapped `payments` include in try/except to allow `migrate` to run during diagnosis.
- LOCAL_RUN_REPORT.md — this concise report.

Next steps (pick one)
---------------------
- I will implement the robust code fix now (lazy-import + mock) and then run a full end-to-end test (backend + frontend). OR
- I will attempt the environment fix (reinstall stripe) and re-check import/startup.

Tell me which option to take and I will proceed immediately and update this report with the results.

What I did (concise)
-------------------
- Installed backend requirements into the workspace venv:
  /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/FullStack_Ecommerce_App/backend/requirements.txt
  Observed: packages installed or already satisfied in the venv.

- Attempted to run migrations and encountered import error from `stripe` (stripe.six.moves missing) when Django loaded `payments` during URLConf import:
  /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/.venv/bin/python /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/FullStack_Ecommerce_App/backend/manage.py migrate --noinput
  Observed: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'stripe.six.moves'

- To allow management commands to run I temporarily wrapped including `payments.urls` in `my_project/urls.py` with try/except so import-time stripe errors don't block `migrate`.

- Re-ran migrations after guarded include:
  /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/.venv/bin/python /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/FullStack_Ecommerce_App/backend/manage.py migrate --noinput
  Observed: Operations to perform: No migrations to apply.

- Started additional dev servers (kept existing server running) using the exact python/manage.py path on alternate ports for local testing (example shown):
  /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/.venv/bin/python /home/abdurahim/Desktop/Andrew_samples/FullStack_Ecommerce_App/backend/manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8001 --noreload
  Observed: Development server started and listening on the requested port (logs printed).

- Created this `LOCAL_RUN_REPORT.md` with findings and next steps.
